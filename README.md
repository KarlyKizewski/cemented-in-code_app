Cemented in Code - A Code-Based Cemetary.

Accessible anytime, anywhere (with Internet). Write a eulogy for a loved one and bury it in zeros and ones - eternal. This project was made after the loss of my family pup. I wanted to keep his memory here and visit him in a space that is clean, simple and approachable. More updates will be made to allow search capabilities and a pop-up for new headstone engravings - using Bootstrap Modal. 

I hope for participation in this healing project. It means a lot to me and I welcome and value anyone who is open to it.
